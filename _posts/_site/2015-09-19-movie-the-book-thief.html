<p>This is <em>NOT</em> a movie review. I don’t know enough about movies to do a review.</p>

<p>With that out of the way, I’d really recommend everyone to watch this one. I came up across it while reading a review of “The Grand Budapest Hotel”.</p>

<p>The movie is set in WW II era Germany, and is a story of war, love, hate and books. Shot in a quirky way, each scene is a delight to the eye. The story and acting is amazing. High on emotions, it’ll bring  a tear to your eye, even if you, like me, are dead inside.</p>

<p>I wish more such movies were made.</p>
