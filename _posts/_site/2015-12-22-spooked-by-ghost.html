<p>So, I just shifted my blog from Ghost to Jekyll. Since I couldn’t figure out Jekyll, I decided to use it until I could. Now I am blogging like a hacker!</p>

<p>Anyway, I am too embarrassed by the <em>spaghetti mess</em> in my CSS and Sass, so I’ve made the repository private. Cheers! :raised_hands:</p>
