I realized last week that too many people knew me just as "the guy who posts photos to Facebook/Instagram."
 While it was nice to hear people appreciate something I do, (and know me for that), I was hurt by it a bit too. I am so much more than my cracked phone camera. A Kabir concert, a couple of books and some self reflection has made me realize, I am looking in all the wrong places, barking up the wrong trees. 

To fix this, I have decided to try out an experiment, I have deactivated facebook, instagram, and uninstalled all social apps. I have made a personal rule to only reply to messages, and not start conversation. 
It would be interesting to see what problems I face because of this and what do I learn. And how long can I last without all this. Will report back.

Till then a few updates : I will be an intern in a valley based company for the summer, I am TA for two courses now and a part for the Storage Systems Research Center. And yes, I am more confused than ever. 

Peace ✌️
