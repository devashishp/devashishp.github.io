I promised myself that I would blog through grad school, yet I didn't. My last post is just after I entered UCSC. After I switched to PhD, I have decided that I am going to perform necromancy here, to revive this dead blog.

I have build this new blog using [hugo](https://gohugo.io) which should be leaner, meaner and cleaner.
There have been updates here and there meanwhile, you can see them in the [About](/about) and [Timeline](/timeline) sections.
