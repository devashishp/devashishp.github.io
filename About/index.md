# My Name

#### First Name

Devashish is a *[samāsa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit_compound)* of the words Deva (God) and Ashish (Blessing). You can call me Dev, I prefer it short. However if you want to get it right, you will have to pronounce it Devá with a soft d like "th" in then, and "Ashish" making it Devashish. If you insist on getting it perfect, you have the pronounce the last "sh" as /ʂ/. It's written देवाशिष in Hindi/Marathi/Sanskrit.

#### Last Name

It is **Purandare**. ...
The closest approximation I could come up with was *"Pooh-Ran-The-Ray."*. Good luck with that. It's written पुरंदरे in Hindi/Marathi/Sanskrit.

I am **NOT** a bot. Why would you ask!?
